As railway tunnels are excavated, the dense rocks are removed, leaving one side hanging in the air while the other side remains connected to the original rock mass. The accumulated energy erupts in an instant, and rock fragments fly in all directions - this is called a rock burst.

Rock bursts are one of the main safety hazards faced by deep-buried hard rock mountain tunnels during construction, directly threatening the safety of personnel and equipment. Professor He Benguo, the on-site technical manager of Northeastern University's major railway rock burst technology research group, said that their main work is to conduct safety monitoring and on-site experimental research at the engineering site, responsible for rock burst monitoring, early warning, and prevention. They have installed a team-developed rock burst intelligent monitoring and early warning system to support the safe and efficient construction of the project with technology.

The group members start working in the tunnel when it's still dark outside and often work until three or four in the afternoon, then continue with data monitoring and analysis outside the tunnel. To collect detailed geological, construction, and occurrence process information about rock bursts, group members often need to work more than eight hours in a cave with an altitude of three to four thousand meters and extremely high risk of rock bursts.

What are the research conditions like inside the tunnel? As soon as you enter the tunnel, you will be soaked through in no time. There is often dripping water from the walls, and the high temperature and humidity turn the tunnel into a "sauna." In winter, when the outdoor temperature is below 0°C, the temperature difference between inside and outside the tunnel can reach more than 40°C. Often, a fully wet "water person" who comes out of the tunnel turns into an "ice person" in a short time.

In the face of tough working conditions, the rock burst technology research group has demonstrated a spirit of overcoming difficulties and taking the lead by moving their laboratory to the project construction site. When they first entered the tunnel, the efficiency of rock burst microseismic monitoring data processing was low, and there was a significant difference in data processing standards among different personnel, which affected the accuracy of early warning. Under Feng Xiating's careful guidance, project team teachers and students used artificial intelligence to establish an intelligent analysis method for microseismic data processing, built a rock burst intelligent monitoring and early warning system, unified data processing standards, improved data processing efficiency, and ensured timely early warning...
